I inserted random, then used define and the for loop to create radom colored quadrilaterals and circles. The difficulties I faced at the beginning is that it took me too long to create a quadilateral that is not a rectangle. I looked up on the website and found two useful resources that I followed in my project:

In the future, I will explore if I can make a slot for visitors to fill in as a image generator so that the shape will be able to change due to the data visitors entered.
